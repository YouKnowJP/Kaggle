    "**üëãüõ≥Ô∏è Ahoy, welcome to Kaggle! You‚Äôre in the right place.**\n",
    "This is the legendary Titanic ML competition ‚Äì the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here: https://discord.gg/kaggle**\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you‚Äôre ready to start competing, click on the \"Join Competition button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook‚Äôs Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n",

    "## The Challenge\n",
    "The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)."

    "training set (train.csv), test set (test.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The training set** should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù) for each passenger. Your model will be based on ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù like passengers‚Äô gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The test set** should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also include **gender_submission.csv**, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like."
